I think it would be safe to say that every single developer ever have at some point stood on the shoulders of giants. 
Even the very first coding pioneers, who boldly went where no-one had gone before, did so on machines created by 
other giants. 

And, I guess, because we view these people as giants, it becomes pretty hard to ever imagine that you can contribute to
the community and add some knowledge and become one of the steps another developer can take to realise his or her own 
potential.

**WHOA**. Let's read that last sentence again? Let's not become another article of highfalutin language while saying
very little. I think we should rather take a fun journey down the road of getting out of your comfort zone and sharing.

For me, that **SMACK** came middle 2015. After many months of using AngularJS in various web applications and bumping
heads with the challenges of using such a framework in a serious application, our team found that we had collected
quite a few answers that worked very well. And that is when we decided to create an in-house AngularJS training. 

Who could have imagined the journey we were about to embark on!

So let's summarise the lessons we have learnt. After that I will go into each point showing the result to give you an 
idea of how to approach this.

* There are no experts in your course.
* Developers love code.
* Create a structure that does not fall down.
* People come for the latest information.
* Don't cheat! Don't show something you don't do yourself.
* Make it fun. Humour is your friend.
* Enjoy the little things.
* Keep them awake!
* Give them something to take home.

**There are no experts in your course.**

Let's get this out there from the get-go. The reason anyone wants to come to your training course is because you
know something they don't. They already know this. You don't have to keep telling them that.

Who amongst us have not at some point been 

**Developers love code.**

The main reason we write code is because we love to code. Don't forget that. 

This is the reason that every development course worth its salt features functional code examples.

So we set out to make a one-stop-shop for a someone who wanted to use 
AngularJS to develop serious applications. You know, translate the questions we struggled with into answers. And this
lead to us creating the mother of all course example applications (*or at least the mother of all course example
application we had ever seen*).

This application would show code examples inside areas demonstrating the actual running examples.

And the most important part was staying up to date with the newest functionality in the framework.

Yup, as there was to be sections on unit testing, the example application itself would need to be tested.

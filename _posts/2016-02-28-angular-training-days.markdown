I think it would be safe to say that every single developer ever have at some point stood on the shoulders of giants. 
Even the very first coding pioneers, who boldly went where no-one had gone before, did so on machines created by 
other giants. 

And, I guess, because we view these people as giants, it becomes pretty hard to ever imagine that you can contribute to
the community and add some knowledge and become one of the steps another developer can take to realise his or her own 
potential.

**WHOA**. Let's read that last sentence again? Let's not become another article of highfalutin language while saying
very little. I think we should rather take a fun journey down the road of getting out of your comfort zone and sharing.

For me, that **SMACK** came middle 2015. After many months of using AngularJS in various web applications and bumping
heads with the challenges of using such a framework in a serious application, our team found that we had collected
quite a few answers that worked very well. And that is when we decided to create an in-house AngularJS training. 

Who could have imagined the journey we were about to embark on!

>*"But there are so many training courses and tutorials our there!"*

And that is true, but what we wanted to do differently was to give a one-stop-shop for a someone who wanted to use 
AngularJS to develop serious applications. You know, translate the questions we struggled with into answers. And what
better way is there than to present this in the form of raw functional code.

So we went to create a functional application that would serve as example for all the would be victims of our training
course.

This application would show code examples inside areas demonstrating the actual running examples.

        <figcaption>Showing code example in blocks containing the actual function was our goal.</figcaption>

And the most important part was staying up to date with the newest functionality in the framework.

Yup, as there was to be sections on unit testing, the example application itself would need to be tested.

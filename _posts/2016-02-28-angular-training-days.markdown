I think it would be safe to say that every single developer ever have at some point stood on the shoulders of giants. 
Even the very first coding pioneers, who boldly went where no-one had gone before, did so on machines created by 
other giants. 

And, I guess, because we view these people as giants, it becomes pretty hard to ever imagine that you can contribute to
the community and add some knowledge and become one of the steps another developer can take to realise his or her own 
potential.

**WHOA**. Let's read that last sentence again? Let's not become another article of highfalutin language while saying
very little. I think we should rather take a fun journey down the road of getting out of your comfort zone and sharing.

>budget cuts **YOU** will have to imagine it. You know, said bird tumbling through the air only to hit mother
>earth with a **SMACK***.

For me, that **SMACK** came middle 2015. After many months of using AngularJS in various web applications and bumping
heads with the challenges of using such a framework in a serious application, our team found that we had collected
quite a few answers that worked very well. And that is when we decided to create an in-house AngularJS training. 

Who could have imagined the journey we were about to embark on!

So let's summarise the lessons we have learnt. After that I will go into each point showing the result to give you an 
idea of how to approach this.

* There are no experts in your course.
* Developers love code.
* Create a structure that does not fall down.
* Don't sell antiques.
* Don't cheat! Don't show something you don't do yourself.
* Make it fun. Humour is your friend.
* Enjoy the little things.
* Keep them awake!
* Give them something to take home.

**There are no experts in your course.**

Let's get this out there from the get-go. The reason anyone wants to come to your training course is because you
know something they don't. They already know this. You don't have to keep telling them that.

Few things will frustrate your students as much as the feeling that your course can only be understood by someone 
who already knows the subject matter.

So avoid acronym hell and explain things that seem obvious to you. You will be surprised how many people in your course
have never even heard about the concept that you use every day.

**Developers love code.**

The main reason we write code is because we love to code. Don't forget that. 

This is the reason that every development course worth its salt features functional code examples.

So we set out to make a one-stop-shop for a someone who wanted to use 
AngularJS to develop serious applications. You know, translate the questions we struggled with into answers. And this
lead to us creating the mother of all course example applications (*or at least the mother of all course example
application we had ever seen*).

We created a showcase of example code blocks right next to actual working examples of the code being demonstrated. This 
way the developer in question could hack into the actual working code if required.

**Create a structure that does not fall down.**

Your course will stand or fall depending on its structure. You got to get this one right.

Separate the easy concepts from the hard ones and don't go jumping in with a gigantic **YEEEEHAAAAWWWW!**. Create a 
logical flow of concepts and bounce it of someone else to see if it makes sense to them as well.

Once you have an outline you can start filling out the concepts. If the outline is clear and understandable you are well
on your way to creating a course that others can follow.

**Don't sell antiques.**

Another reason people go to training courses is to learn about the latest and greatest in their area of interest. No 
one wants to see how things were done yesterday so keep your course updated. 

We kept up to date with our example application, refactoring it before every new session and adding the new stable
functions in AngularJS as well as keeping up to date with best practise. 
 
By doing this we could proudly show the AngularJS 1.5.0 component within days of its release!

**Don't cheat! Don't show something you don't do yourself.**

If you want your students to follow you have to be willing to do it all yourself. Do not opt for shortcuts and steer 
clear of *Don't do as I do, do as I say*.

In our training course we covered AngularJS unit testing in detail. So we decided to write unit tests for our training
application. And I am talking 100% code coverage here.

Doing this means more work later when you have to adjust, but go this extra mile and most of your students will be 
willing to walk that mile with you.

**Make it fun. Humour is your friend.**

If your students are smiling and laughing it is usually a good sign. Unless they are laughing at you, of course.

But seriously, don't be too serious. Keep the mood light and add fun things to your training. 

That said, don't be a clown. No one likes a clown. Clowns are creepy. (*If you are a reading this and your other
occupation is being a clown, you'll know this is a joke as you are a clown.*)

We ended up supporting our example application with a set of slides designed to be as much fun as possible.

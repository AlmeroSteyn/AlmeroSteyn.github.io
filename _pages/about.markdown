I am crazy about Angular. Let's get that straight. Hey, I work as an Angular Engineer and Trainer. That's a lot of Angular
every day!

I am also wild about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank">a11y</a>.

Let's get something else straight. The internet is for everyone. Those making webpages deserve great tools and technologies, 
while those we inflict our creations on deserve a great accessible experience.

When not busy working on awesome projects at a great company in the Netherlands, called <a href="http://www.qdelft.nl" target="_blank">QDelft</a>, 
I can be found working on this blog, looking at great new technologies or spending my time on one of various other geeky pastimes.

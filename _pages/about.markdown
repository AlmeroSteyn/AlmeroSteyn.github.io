I am Almero Steyn and I am crazy about Angular. Let's get that straight. Hey, I am an Angular Engineer and Angular Trainer. That's a lot of Angular every day!

I am also wild about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank">a11y</a> and my specific mission is to
help people build accessible websites in Angular.

When not busy working on awesome projects at a great company in the Netherlands, called <a href="http://www.qdelft.nl" target="_blank">QDelft</a>, 
I can be found writing articles for this blog, looking at great new technologies or spending my time on one of various other geeky pastimes.

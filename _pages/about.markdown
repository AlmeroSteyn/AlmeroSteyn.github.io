I am Almero Steyn and I am crazy about front end development. 

I am also wild about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank">a11y</a> and my specific mission is to
help people build inclusive websites with JavaScript frameworks.

When not busy working on awesome projects, I can be found writing articles for this blog, looking at great new technologies or spending my time on one of various other geeky pastimes.

In this blog I bring you some of my experiences from the trenches.

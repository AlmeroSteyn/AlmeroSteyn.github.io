The maker of this blog is crazy about Angular. Let's get that straight. He works as an Angular Engineer and Trainer.

He is also wild about a11y.

He also believes that the internet is for everyone. Those making webpages deserve great tools and technologies, while those
we inflict our creations on deserve a great accessible experience.

When not busy working on awesome projects at a great company in the Netherlands, called <a href="http://www.qdelft.nl" target="_blank">QDelft</a>, 
he can be found working on this blog, looking at great new technologies or spending his time of one of various other geeky pastimes.
